# WaterNet Project

A library written in C # for parsing or generating the Minecraft protocol.

You can use the WaterNet protocol library to communicate with Minecraft servers or clients, or act as an intermediary to modify communication packets between clients and servers.

It is worth noting that the protocol library is based on the Minecraft Java version and may not be compatible with the Minecraft Bedlock version.
